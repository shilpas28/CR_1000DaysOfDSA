//Leetcode
//1930. Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences
//Time complexity: O(N) - Since we iterating two passes, first pass to compute first and last occurence for each character with 
//time N and second pass to compute number of unique palindromes. In the second pass we iterate over all the unique characters 
//which are 26 and we iterate between their first and last occurence to compute the number of unique characters which can be 
//at most N characters. So time complexity is 26 * N + N which is 27 * N which is also O(N). Where N is number of characters in 
//our input string.
//Sapce complexity: O(1) - Since we are storing two arrays to compute last and first occurence each one of them is of size 26 
//and we use hash set that can be at maximum with size 26 so the space complexity is still O(1). Since we have constant 
//space variables.

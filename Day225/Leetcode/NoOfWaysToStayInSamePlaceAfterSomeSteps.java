//1269. Number of Ways to Stay in the Same Place After Some Steps - Tabulation/Bottom up
//Time complexity: The code uses a nested loop, where the outer loop runs m times, and the inner loop runs n times. So, the 
//time complexity is O(mâˆ—n). In the worst case, where m is large, this algorithm can have a time complexity 
//of O(steps^2)
//Space complexity: The space complexity is determined by the 2D array dp, which has dimensions (m + 1) x n. So, the 
//space complexity is O(m * n). In the worst case, where m is large, this algorithm can have a space complexity of O(steps^2).

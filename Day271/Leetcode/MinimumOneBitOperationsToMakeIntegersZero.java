//Leetcode
//1611. Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero
//Time complexity: O(log n) - The recursive approach involves dividing the problem into subproblems, and the depth of the 
//recursion is logarithmic in n.
//Space complexity: O(log n) - The space complexity is determined by the maximum depth of the recursion stack.
